## Overview

Random Forest Regression is a robust and versatile machine learning algorithm that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the mean prediction of the individual trees. It's an ensemble learning method that is particularly effective in handling complex datasets with high accuracy. This repository not only demonstrates the practical implementation of Random Forest Regression in Python but also provides an in-depth exploration of its principles, advantages, and considerations.

## Repository Structure
